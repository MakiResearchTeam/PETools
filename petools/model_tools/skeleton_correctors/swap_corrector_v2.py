        Performs prediction-correction of the five `points_pair`.
        First, the corrector checks is the human is turned sidewards via looking at the distance
        between `etalon` points.
        if abs(p1 - p2) < abs(et1 - et2) * et3:
            # human turned sidewards, perform reset
        else:
            # perform correction
        Second, it gathers statistics about the motion of the points.
        Third, it predicts current position of the points via gathered statistics from the previous step. If the swap
        wasn't predicted but actually happened, the new points are claimed to wrong and are being replaced with the ones
        from the previous step.

        Parameters
        ----------
        points_pair : array of len 2
            A pair of indices of the points that are prone to erroneous swap.
        momentum : float
            The speed of the points is computed as speed(t) = speed(t-1)*momentum + measured_speed*(1 - momentum).
        acceleration : float
            Current position of a point is being predicted as cur_x = prev_x + acceleration * speed
        p_visible : float
            If any of the points in `points_pair` have a probability less than `p_visible`, the corrector performs
            reset as one of the points was considered to be absent.
        etalon : array of len 3
            Contains a pair of indices for etalon points and a tolerance factor (float in [0, 1]). Etalon points
            are such points that are constantly distant (the same distance) from each other. For example,
            left knee and left foot. Distance between those points is used to determine whether the person is turned
            sidewards (or to determine the proximity in which points from `points_pair` are lying; if the points are
            close enough, the corrector performs reset).
